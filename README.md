# 🫀 MedInfo Simplifier – Hackathon Challenge

### Problem Statement

Patients with implantable cardiac devices often receive complex medical reports filled with unknown terms or alerts they struggle to interpret.

**Your challenge:**  
Design a **website or mobile app** that helps patients simplify medical information — particularly for heart failure — so they can clearly understand their health and feel more connected to their care.

## 💡 Core Functionalities

1. **Secure Login & Logout System for Patients**  
   - Protect patient data with authentication and authorization.

2. **Upload or Input Capability**  
   - Allow users to upload or input medical data (e.g., PDFs, text entries).

3. **Medical Term Recognition**  
   - Utilize trusted sources like WebMD or Harvard Health.  
   - Maintain a lookup method or internal dictionary for term recognition.

4. **Medical Translation Engine**  
   - Likely incorporates AI for summarization and interpretation.  
   - Provide structured output such as:
     ```
     Term | Meaning | Why it Matters
     ```

5. **Simple Accessibility & Design**  
   - Use clean layouts, readable fonts, and intuitive navigation.  
   - Prioritize accessibility for older patient demographics.

## 🚀 Bonus / Optional Functionalities

- **Chatbot or Voice Assistant**  
  - Help patients ask health-related questions conversationally.

- **Multilingual Support**  
  - Make the app accessible to non-English-speaking users.

- **Lightweight or Offline Mode**  
  - Enable use without internet; focus on design efficiency and caching.

- **Gamification or Learning System**  
  - Quiz patients to reinforce health literacy.  
  - Include visuals or animations to explain medical terms.
